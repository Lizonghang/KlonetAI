This repo provides an AI agent for intelligent interaction with the 
Klonet platform. Some examples are provided to show what this repo 
is used for, as below.

```python
import tool
import tutorial
import inspect
from transformers.tools import OpenAiAgent

# Collect our KlonetAI tools.
klonetai_tools = [
    obj() for name, obj in inspect.getmembers(tool, inspect.isclass) 
        + inspect.getmembers(tutorial, inspect.isclass)]

# Replace <OpenAI-API-Key> with your actual OpenAI API key.
api_key = "<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>"

# Instantiate the Agent with our KlonetAI tools.
agent = OpenAiAgent(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key, additional_tools=custom_tools)
```

Next, we can use <code>agent</code> to interact with KlonetAI. For example:

### Case 1: Generate the Network Topology: Internet2
```python
>>> agent.chat("Create an Internet2 network topology with interconnected links." 
"Internet2 is a secure, high-speed network that provides services for research "
"and education.")
```
```text
Outputs:

==Explanation from the agent==
To create an Internet2 network topology, we will use the `klonet_add_node` and `klonet_add_link` tools. We will add nodes representing the major hubs in the Internet2 network and then connect them with links. 

Please note that this is a simplified version of the Internet2 network topology. In reality, the Internet2 network has many more nodes and links.

### Case 2: Create a Star Topology and Launch MXNET Distributed Training
```python
>>> agent.chat("Create a star network with 6 nodes and 1 ovs, " 
"deploy 1 MXNET scheduler, 2 MXNET server, and 3 MXNET workers on these " 
"nodes, and run MXNET jobs. The scheduler is launched on IP 192.168.1.22. " 
"Do not use ListComp and BinOp, write the codes line by line instead.")
```

Outputs:

==Explanation from the agent==
I will use the following tools: `klonet_add_node` to add nodes to the network, `klonet_add_link` to create network links between nodes, `klonet_deploy_network` to deploy the network, and `klonet_command_exec` to run MXNET jobs.
